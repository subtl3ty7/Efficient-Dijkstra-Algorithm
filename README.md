# Efficient-Dijkstra-Algorithm
Efficient Dijkstra Algorithm using Priority Queue as Min Heap

This program implements the Dijkstra Shortest Path Algorithm using a Priority Queue as a Min Heap.

-Running the test class begins a command prompt which asks for user to choose one of available .csv datas to run and test the algorithm.
-Own datas can be put into the folder "instances".
-After finishing testing, program saves the .csv solution in "solutions" folder.
-To evaluate the solution, simply open the plot.html file under "evaluation" folder and upload the solution file there.
-Evaluation function compares solutions Min Heap, Fibonacci Heap, Simple Queue.
